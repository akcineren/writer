1. Create an interactive 2D precision bombing simulation
2. Use Python
3. Use the tkinter library
4. Simulate a lone bomber that the user pilots
5. Allow the user to drop multiple bombs on scattered targets
6. Implement gravity to accelerate each bomb downward
7. Implement wind resistance to slow and deflect bomb trajectories
8. Include vivid explosion animations when bombs hit targets
9. Provide the complete code for the simulation
10. Include controls for aiming and dropping bombs
11. End the simulation after sixty seconds
